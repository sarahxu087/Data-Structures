Why is a good idea use DLL?
- A DLL allows us to go in both directions forward and backward
- The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be
    deleted is given.
- We can quickly insert a new node before a given node
In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous node is needed.
To get this previous node, sometimes the list is traversed. In DLL, we can get the previous node using previous pointer.

Disadvantage:
- It uses extra memory when compared to array and singly linked list.
- Since elements in memory are stored randomly, hence elements are accessed sequentially no direct access is allowed.

1) Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer. It is possible to implement DLL with single pointer though.
2) All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained.
For example, in insertion, we need to modify previous pointers together with next pointers. 
 

Insertion
A node can be added in four ways
1) At the front of the DLL
2) After a given node.
3) At the end of the DLL
4) Before a given node.
